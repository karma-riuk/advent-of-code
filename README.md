# Advent of Code

## What is it?

> from the [adventofcode.com/about](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar (written by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/))
of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that
can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Why is it?

People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework,
practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. 

Personally, I started using it as a hobby, but then, after hearing [ThePrimeagen
saying it was a great idea to use it as a way to learn a new programming
language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8cM12jRH7k), I started doing the
challenges to learn the `go` programming language, because why not?

## What can you find here?

In this repository you can find my solutions to the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.
I've never completed an entire Advent of Code calendar because the final
puzzles are usually pretty hard and I didn't (and still don't) have time to
obsess about them. I try to keep this as a fun experience to solve problems and
learn new things, nothing too hardcore.

I'll try to answer it :)
